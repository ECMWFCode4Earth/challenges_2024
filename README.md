# ECMWF Code for Earth 2024

**ECMWF Code for Earth is an innovation programme run by the [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)](https://www.ecmwf.int/).** Its aim is to drive innovation and open source developments in the Earth sciences community - supporting developments in weather and climate, the two Copernicus services ([Copernicus Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu/) and [Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/)) and [Destination Earth](https://www.ecmwf.int/destine).

Since 2018, each summer, developer teams work together with experienced mentors from ECMWF and partner organisations on innovative projects. These projects are related to the broad scope of activities at ECMWF, including data science, weather, climate or other earth sciences, visualisation and more.

## How it works

### 1. Call for Participation: 29 Feb - 9 Apr 2024
Browse through the [Code for Earth challenges](https://github.com/ECMWFCode4Earth/challenges_2024/issues), ask questions and together with the mentors, tailor your proposal. Submit your proposal by 9 April 2024.

### 2. Announcement of selected proposals: 29 Apr 2024
The selected Code for Earth 2024 project teams will be announced on 29 Apr 2024.

### 3. Coding phase: 2 May  - 31 Aug 2024
The four-month long coding period starts on 02 May 2024 and ends on 31 August 2024. During this time, the selected teams will work with their Code for Earth mentors. These are experts in earth sciences like weather, climate and climate change, atmosphere and air quality or in technology areas like AI/ML, cloud computing, applied data science or open source software development.

### 4. Final Code for Earth day: 18 September 2024
The Code for Earth day is a celebratory completion of the programme. This year the event will be hosted at ECMWF's headquarters in Reading, Uk.
Teams will be invited to present their project results.

Successfully completed projects will receive a €5,000 stipend.
